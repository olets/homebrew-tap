    <<~EOS
      To activate abbreviations, add the following at the end of your .zshrc:
        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh-abbr/zsh-abbr.zsh
      Then to activate abbreviations in already open sessions, reload .zshrc:
        source ~/.zshrc
    EOS

    assert_match 'true',
      shell_output("zsh -c '. #{pkgshare}/zsh-abbr.zsh && echo $ZSH_ABBR_DEFAULT_BINDINGS'")
