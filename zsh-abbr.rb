  def caveats
    <<~EOS

      To activate abbreviations, add the following at the end of your .zshrc:

        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh-abbr/zsh-abbr.zsh

      If you prefer to manage the package with Homebrew but load it with
      a plugin manager, use your plugin manager to load the above path
      rather than `source`ing it.

      Then to activate abbreviations in already open sessions, restart zsh. Run:

        exec zsh

    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "1",
                 shell_output("zsh -c '. #{pkgshare}/zsh-abbr.zsh && echo $ZSH_ABBR_DEFAULT_BINDINGS'")
  end
end
